*Due to the fact that Brushshe switched to PIL.ImageDraw in v1.0.0, some functions, especially shapes and fonts, have undergone changes. But now the program is more optimized and does not start to slow down if you draw for a long time.*

## Translations
The internationalization of this program has a simple principle - it determines what the computer's localization is (for example, *en*, *ru*, etc.), and then applies the `Brushshe/locales/{localization}.json` file, where *localization* is the computer's localization.
